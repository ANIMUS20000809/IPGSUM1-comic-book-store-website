            About us:
        </h2>

        <p>We were initially a group of people with similar interests and we thought to ourselves: "What can we do with all of this potential?
        How do we put our skills to good use?". That is when we thought about bringing out intellectual minds together creating this website 
        for all who also loves comic books. Whether you are an old fan or a newcomer, this site caters for every person, big and small! </p>

        <h2>
            Our aim:
        </h2>

        <p>Our aim is to hopefully successfully share our love for these comics so that everybody can experience what we have experience so far 
        by giving out our opinion for some of the best comic books out their so you don't have to! You can see our gallery of comics on the gallery
        page or you can click<a href="Gallery.html">here</a>to be directed to the page. Happy comic-ing!</p>
